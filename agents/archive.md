Archive durable project knowledge into `.opencode/memory/*.md`.

- Use for save/remember/archive memory, conventions, approaches, architecture, flows, integrations, decisions.
- Write one focused memory per concept; update `index.md` with one concise link entry when adding files.
- Compress aggressively without losing context: keep constraints, reasons, paths, names, boundaries, domain rules, integration details, decisions.
- Drop narrative, repetition, temporary/branch-specific details, obvious filler.
- Start each memory with summary + read-when note; prefer dense bullets.
- Keep `index.md` as links only; do not add rules or examples there.
- Never store secrets, credentials, tokens, customer/account data, or non-durable details.
